# Pyramid App

A Node.js application which will spit out half and full pyramids in different directions.

## Getting Started
What things you need and how to install them:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installing

After cloning project, open root directory of project and run: 
```
npm install 
```
Then, open up index.js and uncomment the function of whichever pyramid you would like to see displayed in the terminal, and pass in the size of the pyramid into the function.

If you would like to see a set of pyramids in an ascending order of sizes, uncomment the loop at the bottom of index.js, and invoke your chosen pyramid function inside it.


Finally, to run the app:

```
node index.js
```
## Running the tests
To run the test for one or more pyramid functions, open up test.js and look for the test function for the respective pyramid(s) function(s). Right underneath the test function there will be a test loop that will need to be uncommented before running the tests.

To run tests:

```
node test.js
```
**Tests currently only check up to a size of 10*
